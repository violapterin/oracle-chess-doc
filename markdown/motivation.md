# Motivation

The Oracle Chess can be motivated the same way other people invent Chess variants: to regain the fun of Chess

The Chess has been intensively played and studied for several hundred years.
In particular, in 21 century the theory of Chess has seen significant progress with help of computers, and the game databases grow exponentially thanks to the internet.
Of course, to human, there is still essentially infinite mystery about Chess to be explored, 
Chess is still exciting, [new], [creative].
But as time passes, the more work has done on it, the more we have to learn.
With so much material accumulated, and players more competitive than ever, playing and studying rely increasingly on rote memory, especially for openings.
As an entertainment activity it start to seem like chore.

It is worth considering to play and study a new game too, in addition to Chess.

The sentiment has been expressed by Casablanca

I believe S-chess is nonideal in that there is too many strong pieces in the start.
