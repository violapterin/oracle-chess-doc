# Oracle Chess
A Chess Variant

*Oracle Chess* is a novel chess variant I invented, which introduced fairy pieces, Shogi-like dropping rule, and more, while preserving the fun and depth Chess has, but maintaining a careful balance.
The document is organized as follows.
We first go through a concise description of rules, and next I provide the motivation for introducing these features.
Then, after we the convention on notation, symbol, and token design, we see examples in progressively larger scope: Illustrated examples of rules, tactic and strategic vignettes, and finally full games.
I provided a more detailed description of rules to ensure absolute unambiguity and consistency, but ordered it to the last, intending it to be a reference.
Finally, some links are cited, and a license is declared.
